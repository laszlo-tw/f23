## Instructions for the exam

* The exam will be online via Gradescope on Monday June 6, 4p - 6p. Students who have DSP accommodations will receive extended time as per their accommodations

* The exam will naturally be open book and open notes and you can use your computer to verify/test any code that you write. You may not refer any online website other than https://www.cplusplus.com/, or seek help from any individual inside or outside the course. If we find evidence of collusion and academic dishonesty all students involved will be given an F without recourse. Please take academic integrity **very** seriously.

* You may post questions privately on Piazza to the course staff during the exam.

* Good luck with the exam and I hope those of you who are ill at this time with Covid feel better.
